function name_of_function (input_parameter)
	It makes the file callable by running name_of_function (input_parameter).
If there is varargin defined in the function, calling the function is different from that in python. You need to use ('parameter_name', parameter_value) instead of (parameter_name = parameter_value)
savepath
	After addpath, run it to save paths to Matlab, so that no need to addpath later.
doc method_name
	to call help for the method or class
